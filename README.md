This is designed with the idea of trying to combine the Pixel Game Engine along with other libraries, AKA using the C++ Pixel Game Engine.

Very work in progress - somewhat aimed at A-Level Coursework with the idea of creating a 3D rendering program combined with a friendly menu system.

Currently working on the front end side of things, which I hate, and I've only got a Python version of the Graphics themselves.

(Trying my best :'))
